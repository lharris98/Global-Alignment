# global-alignment
Python command line program that will take a fasta file with two DNA sequences and globally align them.
Biopython must be installed to use this program. 
To make executable from the command line, use: $ chmod +x global-alignment.py. 
Include a single argument of the fasta file containing the two sequences that will be aligned. The program will then run and the alignment result will be printed to standard output.
